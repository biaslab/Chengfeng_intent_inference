# Intent Inference Project Overview

This project focuses on inferring the intended trajectories of ships in various marine traffic situations. It represents a collaborative effort between the Bayesian Intelligent Autonomous Systems lab at TU Eindhoven and Wuhan University of Technology.

**Project Components:**

1. **Simulation Results:**
   - [Ship trajectory different situations.ipynb](https://github.com/biaslab/Chengfeng_intent_inference/blob/main/Ship%20trajectory%20different%20situations.ipynb)
     - This notebook showcases simulation results in overtaking, head-on, and crossing situations.

2. **Intent Inference Code:**
   - [all_Ship trajectory with 9 intents with real data copy.ipynb](https://github.com/biaslab/Chengfeng_intent_inference/blob/main/all_Ship%20trajectory%20with%209%20intents%20with%20real%20data%20copy.ipynb)
     - Contains the intent inference code tailored for real-world AIS data.

3. **Baseline Models:**
   - [compare_model](https://github.com/biaslab/Chengfeng_intent_inference/tree/main/compare_model)
     - This directory includes all baseline models used for comparison.

4. **Additional Intent Inference Cases:**
   - [more_case](https://github.com/biaslab/Chengfeng_intent_inference/tree/main/more_case)
     - Provides additional intent inference cases observed in real-world AIS data.
